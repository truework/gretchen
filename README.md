Making `fetch` happen in TypeScript.

> Looking for more info? Check out [our blog post](https://medium.com/@estrattonbailey/introducing-gretchen-making-fetch-happen-in-typescript-87ab0bd66027?source=friends_link&sk=884da87efacd2db29d670a04f6651f60).

## Features

- **safe:** will not throw on non-200 responses
- **precise:** allows for typing of both success & error responses
- **resilient:** configurable retries & timeout
- **smart:** respects `Retry-After` header
- **small:** won't break your bundle

### Install

```bash
npm i gretchen --save
```

### Browser support

`gretchen` targets all modern browsers. For IE11 support, you'll need to polyfill
`fetch`, `Promise`, and `Object.assign`. For Node.js, you'll need `fetch` and
`AbortController`.

# Usage

With `fetch`, you might do something like this:

```js
const request = await fetch("/api/user/12");
const user = await request.json();
```

With `gretchen`, it's very similar:

```js
import { gretch } from "gretchen";

const { data: user } = await gretch("/api/user/12").json();
```

ðŸ‘‰ `gretchen` aims to provide just enough abstraction to provide ease of use
without sacrificing flexibility.

## Making a request

Using `gretchen` is very similar to using `fetch`. It too defaults to `GET`, and
sets the `credentials` header to `same-origin`.

```js
const request = gretch("/api/user/12");
```

To parse a response body, simply call any of the standard `fetch` [body interface
methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response#Body_Interface_Methods_2):

```js
const response = await request.json();
```

The slight diversion from native `fetch` here is to allow users to do this in
one shot:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12").json();
```

In addition to the _body interface methods_ you're familiar with, there's also a
`flush()` method. This resolves the request _without_ parsing the body (or
errors), which results in slight performance gains. This method returns a
slightly different response object, see below for more details.

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/authenticated").flush();
```

### Options

To make different types of requests or edit headers and other request config,
pass a options object:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  credentials: "include",
  headers: {
    "Tracking-ID": "abcde12345",
  },
}).json();
```

Configuring requests bodies should look familiar as well:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  method: "PATCH",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Megan Rapinoe",
    occupation: "President of the United States",
  }),
}).json();
```

For convenience, thereâ€™s also a `json` shorthand. Weâ€™ll take care of
stringifying the body and applying the `Content-Type` header:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  method: "PATCH",
  json: {
    email: "m.rapinoe@gmail.com",
  },
}).json();
```

#### Retrying requests

`gretchen` will automatically attempt to retry _some_ types of requests if they
return certain error codes. Below are the configurable options and their
defaults:

- `attempts` - a `number` of retries to attempt before failing. Defaults to `2`.
- `codes` - an `array` of `number` status codes that indicate a retry-able
  request. Defaults to `[ 408, 413, 429 ]`.
- `methods` - an `array` of `string`s indicating which request methods should be
  retry-able. Defaults to `[ "GET" ]`.
- `delay` - a `number` in milliseconds used to exponentially back-off the delay
  time between requests. Defaults to `6`. Example: first delay is 6ms, second
  36ms, third 216ms, and so on.

These options can be set using the configuration object:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  retry: {
    attempts: 3,
  },
}).json();
```

#### Timeouts

By default, `gretchen` will time out requests after 10 seconds and retry them, unless otherwise configured. To configure timeout, pass a value in milliseconds:

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  timeout: 20000,
}).json();
```

## Response handling

`gretchen`'s thin abstraction layer returns a specialized structure from a
request. In TypeScript terms, it employs a _discriminated union_ for ease of
typing. More on that later.

```js
const { url, status, error, data, response } = await gretch(
  "/api/user/12"
).json();
```

`url` and `status` here are what they say they are: properties of the `Response`
returned from the request.

#### `data`

If the response returns a `body` and you elect to parse it i.e. `.json()`, it
will be populated here.

#### `error`

And instead of throwing errors `gretchen` will populate the `error` prop with
any errors that occur **_or_** `body`ies returned from non-success (`4xx`)
responses.

Examples of `error` usage:

- a `/login` endpoint returns `401` and includes a message for the user
- an endpoint times out and an `HTTPTimeout` error is returned
- an unknown network error occurs during the request

#### `response`

`gretchen` also provides the full `response` object in case you need it.

#### Usage with `flush`

As mentioned above, `gretchen` also provides a `flush()` method to resolve a
request without parsing the body or errors. This results in a slightly different
response object.

```js
const { url, status, response } = await gretch(
  "/api/user/authenticated"
).flush();
```

## Hooks

`gretchen` uses the concept of "hooks" to tap into the request lifecycle. Hooks
are good for code that needs to run on every request, like adding tracking
headers and logging errors.

Hooks should be defined as an array. That way you can compose multiple hooks
per-request, and define and merge default hooks when [creating
instances](#creating-instances).

#### `before`

The `before` hook runs just prior to the request being made. You can even modify
the request directly, like to add headers. The `before` hook is passed the `Request`
object, and the full options object.

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  hooks: {
    before: [
      (request, options) => {
        request.headers.set("Tracking-ID", "abcde");
      },
    ],
  },
}).json();
```

#### `after`

The `after` runs after the request has resolved and any body interface methods
have been called. It has the opportunity to read the `gretchen` response. It
_cannot_ modify it. This is mostly useful for logging.

```js
const response = await gretch("/api/user/12", {
  hooks: {
    after: [
      ({ url, status, data, error }, options) => {
        sentry.captureMessage(`${url} returned ${status}`);
      },
    ],
  },
}).json();
```

## Creating instances

`gretchen` also exports a `create` method that allows you to configure default
options. This is useful if you want to attach something like logging to every
request made with the returned instance.

```js
import { create } from "gretchen";

const gretch = create({
  headers: {
    "X-Powered-By": "gretchen",
  },
  hooks: {
    after({ error }) {
      if (error) sentry.captureException(error);
    },
  },
});

await gretch("/api/user/12").json();
```

### Base URLs

Another common use case for creating a separate instance is to specify a
`baseURL` for all requests. The `baseURL` will then be resolved against the base
URL of the page, allowing support for both absolute and relative `baseURL`
values.

In the example below, assume requests are being made from a page located at
`https://www.mysite.com`.

Functionally, this:

```js
const gretch = create({
  baseURL: "https://www.mysite.com/api",
});
```

Is equivalent to this:

```js
const gretch = create({
  baseURL: "/api",
});
```

So this request:

```js
await gretch("/user/12").json();
```

Will resolve to `https://www.mysite.com/api/user/12`.

**Note:** if a `baseURL` is specified, URLs will be normalized in order to
concatenate them i.e. a leading slash â€“Â `/user/12` vs `user/12` â€“Â will not
impact how the request is resolved.

## Usage with TypeScript

`gretchen` is written in TypeScript and employs a _discriminated union_ to allow
you to type and consume both the success and error responses returned by your
API.

To do so, pass your data types directly to the `gretch` call:

```typescript
type Success = {
  name: string;
  occupation: string;
};

type Error = {
  code: number;
  errors: string[];
};

const response = await gretch<Success, Error>("/api/user/12").json();
```

Then, you can safely use the responses:

```typescript
if (response.error) {
  const {
    code, // number
    errors, // array of strings
  } = response.error; // typeof Error
} else if (response.data) {
  const {
    name, // string
    occupation, // string
  } = response.data; // typeof Success
}
```

# Why?

There are a lot of options out there for requesting data. But most modern
`fetch` implementations rely on throwing errors. For type-safety, we wanted
something that would allow us to type the response, no matter what. We also
wanted to bake in a few opinions of our own, although the API is flexible enough
for most other applications.
